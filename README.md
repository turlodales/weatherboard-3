new fetures 
no new fetures as of this point not so say it will never happen just not yet just getting it up and running first is the main thing

i will be making this a paid tweak $3.49 the original tweak is $2.49 that will be keeped aside incase the original owner comes back im im not here to rip people off from the date i recive a first payment i will be keeping the $2.49 from every purchase for the original owner for 1 year if he dos not get in contact after one year from the date then i will be keeping the funds and dropping the price back down to the $2.49 as i not here to get rich of someone elses work but just to cover the cost of my time to keep this grate tweak alive.
